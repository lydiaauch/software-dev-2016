## CS4500 Software Development
This repository contains homework submissions for cs4500.
Each assignment is given its own directory which contians a README file explaining the purpose of the assignment, the directory structure of the files in that assignment's folder, and how to run the executable for that assignment.

Directory 14 is the most updated state of the project while the previous directories are older iterations of the assignment. 

The work in this repository is a collaboration between Lydia Auch, Jake Campolo, and Alex Jo.
