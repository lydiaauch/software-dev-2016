An Action4 is [Natural, [GP, ...], [GB, ...], [BT, ...], [RT, ...]]

A Feeding is one of:

    false, meaning the only possibility is to have one of this player’s species attack some other species and the player chooses to forgo any attack now and for the rest of this turn;

    Natural, that is, the index of a single species that is vegetarian and gets the next token of food;

    [Natural, Nat], that is, an index to a given species and desired number of food tokens—meaning the indexed species comes with a fat-tissue trait and wishes to store the specified number of food tokens;

    [Natural, Natural, Natural], that is, an index pointing to a species of the current player, an index for an element of the given sequence of players, and an index for one of its species—meaning the first species attacks the second species, which belongs to the given player.

A Configuration is [LOP+, Natural, LOC].
